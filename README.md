A simple calculator is a basic tool or program designed to perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input numbers and select operations to calculate results quickly.
Overview of the Task:
Input: The calculator takes two or more numbers as inputs and the operation to be performed on them (e.g., +, -, *, /).
Operations: It performs basic operations:
Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts one number from another.
Multiplication (ร): Multiplies two numbers.
Division (รท): Divides one number by another (with error handling for division by zero).
Output: The result of the operation is displayed.
Key Features:
Basic arithmetic functions: These include the four main operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Error handling: The calculator should handle common errors, such as dividing by zero or invalid inputs (like non-numeric characters).
User interface: The user interacts with the calculator through a graphical or command-line interface to enter values and select operations.
Potential Enhancements (for advanced versions):
Multiple operations: Allow for more complex operations such as square roots, exponents, or trigonometric functions.
Memory functions: Store values for later use in calculations.
History tracking: Keep track of previous calculations for easy reference.
The purpose of this task is to implement a simple yet functional calculator that can handle basic arithmetic with minimal complexity.
